Learn the core ideas in machine learning, and build your first models.

## Task

Your cousin has made millions of dollars speculating on real estate. He's offered to become business partners with you because of your interest in data science. He'll supply the money, and you'll supply models that predict how much various houses are worth.

You ask your cousin how he's predicted real estate values in the past, and he says it is just intuition. But more questioning reveals that he's identified price patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and he uses those patterns to make predictions for new houses he is considering.

## Data

- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **data_description.txt** - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
- **sample_submission.csv** - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms
